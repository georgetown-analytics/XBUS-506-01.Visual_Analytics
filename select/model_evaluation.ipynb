    "The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) is a measure of a classifier’s predictive quality that compares and visualizes the tradeoff between the model’s sensitivity and specificity. When plotted, a ROC curve displays the true positive rate on the Y axis and the false positive rate on the X axis on both a global average and per-class basis. The ideal point is therefore the top-left corner of the plot: false positives are zero and true positives are one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to another metric, area under the curve (AUC), which is a computation of the relationship between false positives and true positives. The higher the AUC, the better the model generally is. However, it is also important to inspect the “steepness” of the curve, as this describes the maximization of the true positive rate while minimizing the false positive rate."

Visual classification reports are used to compare classification models to select models that are “redder”, e.g. have stronger classification metrics or that are more balanced.\n",

Positive and negative in this case are generic names for the classes of a binary classification problem. In the example above, we would consider true and false occupied and true and false unoccupied.

Each bar is segmented to show the proportion of predictions (including false negatives and false positives, like a Confusion Matrix) for each class. You can use a `ClassPredictionError` to visualize which classes your classifier is having a particularly difficult time with, and more importantly, what incorrect answers it is giving on a per-class basis.

Generally, model selection is a search problem defined as follows: given N instances described by numeric properties and (optionally) a target for estimation, find a model described by a triple composed of features, an algorithm and hyperparameters that best fits the data. For most purposes the “best” triple refers to the triple that receives the best cross-validated score for the model type.\n",

    "Generally we determine whether a given model is optimal by looking at it’s F1, precision, recall, and accuracy (for classification), or it’s coefficient of determination (R2) and error (for regression). However, real world data is often distributed somewhat unevenly, meaning that the fitted model is likely to perform better on some sections of the data than on others. Yellowbrick’s `CVScores` visualizer enables us to visually explore these variations in performance using different cross validation strategies.\n",

Then `k` models are fit on $\\frac{k-1} {k}$ of the data (called the training split) and evaluated on $\\frac {1} {k}$ of the data (called the test split). The results from each evaluation are averaged together for a final score, then the final model is fit on the entire dataset for operationalization.\n",
