    "In this lab, we will use a familiar dataset to explore the use of visualizations in feature analysis and selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this lab is to work through some of the visualization capabilities available in Seaborn. For a more thorough investigation of the capabilities offered by Seaborn, you are encouraged to do the full tutorial linked below. Seaborn is an API to matplotlib. It integrates with pandas dataframes, simplifying the process of visualizing data. It provides simple functions for plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the features that seaborn offers are\n",
    "\n",
    "* Several built-in themes that improve on the default matplotlib aesthetics\n",
    "* Tools for choosing color palettes to make beautiful plots that reveal patterns in your data\n",
    "* Functions for visualizing univariate and bivariate distributions or for comparing them between subsets of data\n",
    "* Tools that fit and visualize linear regression models for different kinds of independent and dependent variables\n",
    "* Functions that visualize matrices of data and use clustering algorithms to discover structure in those matrices\n",
    "* A function to plot statistical timeseries data with flexible estimation and representation of uncertainty around the estimate\n",
    "* High-level abstractions for structuring grids of plots that let you easily build complex visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to look at 3 useful functions in seaborn: factorplot, pairplot, and joinplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Before running the code in this lab, articulate to your partner what you expect the visualization to look like. Look at the code and the Seaborn documentation to figure out what data is being plotted and what the type of plot may look like.**\n",
